# Cross-Modal-Deepfake-Detection-through-Audio-Video-Analysis
A cross-modal deepfake detection system that analyzes both speech and lip movements to identify manipulated audio-visual content. Unlike traditional methods that focus only on one modality, this project combines audio and video analysis for more accurate, robust, and real-time detection.
